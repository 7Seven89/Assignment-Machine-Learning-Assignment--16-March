    "### Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting, several techniques can be applied:\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Using k-fold cross-validation ensures that the model is tested on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalize large coefficients, forcing the model to be simpler.\n",
    "- **Pruning**: For decision trees, limiting the depth or pruning back branches reduces overfitting.\n",
    "- **Dropout**: In neural networks, dropout randomly turns off some neurons during training to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**: Stop training when the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set starts to degrade.\n",
    "- **Increase Training Data**: With more data, the model is less likely to overfit to specific instances in the dataset."
